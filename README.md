### Built With

- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) - The Progressive Vue.js Framework
- [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) - The Search API allows you to place search fields in your website to search for content within the iTunes Store and Apple Books Store. You can search for a variety of content; including books, movies, podcasts, music, music videos, audiobooks, and TV shows.
- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) - Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.
- [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

- [Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) - Backend developed as Cloud functions. Cloud Functions is Google Cloudâ€™s event-driven serverless compute platform. Run your code locally or in the cloud without having to provision servers. Go from code to deploy with continuous delivery and monitoring tools. Cloud Functions scales up or down, so you pay only for compute resources you use. Easily create end-to-end complex development scenarios by connecting with existing Google Cloud or third-party services.
- [RSS parser](https://github.com/rbren/rss-parser#readme) - A small library for turning RSS XML feeds into JavaScript objects.
